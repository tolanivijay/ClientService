------------------------------- Assumptions ---------------------------------------------

> Registration Service would be called from same java layer considering its input is a
  Java object.If the Service needs to be exposed as Web-Service, will need to convert
  input object to simple form params.
> Have hardcoded the directory name in DAOImpl for simplicity,ideally it would be
  passed as dependency from .properties considering directory paths for various envs would
  be different.Please change directory path after creating respective directory on local.
  
  
 ---------------------------- Other Notes ------------------------------------------------
 
 > All Tests are available under the test package. A few tests might fail in the first run. 
 > Have chosen JAXB and xml combination for parsing as it offers a simplistic approach
   for marshalling-unmarshalling.
 > Have used simple Calender API for deriving age in years,however we have JODA libs which
   provides a comprehensive calculation API around age.If the calculations become any more
   complex,it is highly recommended.
